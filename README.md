# Data Analysis project using Python, SQL, and Google Analytics
# 📊 HCLSoftware – Data Analytics Case Study (Reframed)

## 🔎 Project Overview  
A fictional case study modeling how HCLSoftware clients leverage data analytics platforms (e.g., HCL Actian Data Platform, HCL Discover) to extract insights from traffic and engagement data. Although the original use case involved SEO, this reframed version emphasizes **SQL, Python, statistics, and root cause analysis (RCA)** to demonstrate a clean transition into Data Analytics.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **SQL** – querying and aggregating datasets (traffic logs, campaign records)  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib / Seaborn) – data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering  
- **Statistics** – A/B testing, regression, hypothesis testing  
- **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** – diagnosing engagement drops or pipeline failures  
- **Tableau / Excel** – building dashboards and automated KPI tracking  

## 🎯 Objectives  
1. Understand user engagement patterns across client regions (e.g., U.S., EMEA).  
2. Evaluate marketing campaign performance and conversion impact.  
3. Detect anomalies and uncover root causes of user behavior shifts.  
4. Recommend improvements to enhance client retention and operational resilience.

## 📈 Analysis & Insights  
- Extracted and aggregated **several million** rows of traffic and sign-up data across multiple client regions using **SQL**.  
- Cleaned and harmonized fragmented logs via **Python**, reducing inconsistencies by over **25%**.  
- Set up an **A/B testing framework** to compare baseline vs targeted campaigns—impact measurement revealed a **17% uplift** in conversion for optimized campaigns.  
- Performed **regression analysis** to study the effect of session time and page interactions on subscription likelihood—findings improved UX tactics.  
- Created **automated dashboards** in Tableau tracking key metrics (sessions, bounce rate, conversion rate) across geographies—cutting manual report creation by **50%**.  
- Conducted **Root Cause Analysis** on drop-off incidents—uncovered integration delays and data ingestion lags causing client insight gaps.

## 🚀 Business Impact  
- Boosted conversion rates by **12–18%** via campaign targeting refinements.  
- Reduced data processing and reporting time by **40–50%** using automation tools.  
- Provided actionable, region-specific recommendations that drove engagement and retention improvements across multiple client geographies.
