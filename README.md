## 🛠️ Tools I Used

- **Python** → to clean data, look for patterns, and make simple charts  
- **Excel / Tableau** → to make dashboards and reports  
- **Basic Statistics** → to compare campaign performance and check results

## 🎯 What I Tried to Find Out  
1. Which marketing campaigns brought the most new users?  
2. Do users from different regions behave differently?  
3. Why did traffic or sign-ups drop at certain times?  
4. How can we improve the user experience and conversions?

## 📈 Main Insights  
- **User Behavior**: Weekdays had more activity than weekends, especially mornings.  
- **Campaigns**: Targeted campaigns worked better than general ones (higher conversions).  
- **Engagement**: People who used more features on the site were more likely to return.  
- **Technical Issues**: Drops in traffic matched with server downtime in some regions.  
- **City Growth**: Medium-sized cities showed faster growth than large metro areas.

## 🚀 Business Impact

- Suggested ways to improve the user journey so people come back more often.
