# 📊 HCLSoftware – Data Analysis Case Study (Simplified)

## 🔎 Project Overview  
This case study is inspired by how companies like **HCLSoftware** use data to improve their business.  
I worked on a project where I analyzed data from web traffic, user sign-ups, and marketing campaigns.  
The goal was to **understand user behavior, measure what is working, and suggest improvements.**  

Originally, the project was SEO-focused, but here it is reframed to highlight **data analysis skills**.

## 🛠️ Tools I Used  
- **SQL** → to pull and organize data from different sources  
- **Python** → to clean data, look for patterns, and make simple charts  
- **Excel / Tableau** → to make dashboards and reports  
- **Basic Statistics** → to compare campaign performance and check results

## 🎯 What I Tried to Find Out  
1. Which marketing campaigns brought the most new users?  
2. Do users from different regions behave differently?  
3. Why did traffic or sign-ups drop at certain times?  
4. How can we improve the user experience and conversions?
